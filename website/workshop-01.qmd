**Are we all set up?**
Open the app in `exercises/01_app.R`.
Run the app to make sure it works.
Can everyone in your breakout session run the app?
Help each other make sure you're set up.

**Take a Shiny app and make it bslib-ier**
Replace `fluidPage()` with `page_fluid()`.
What other page types are available?
Try out some [Bootswatch themes](https://bootswatch.com).
For bonus points, try setting [a theme-related Sass variable](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/bs5-variables/index.html).

**Use the app to learn about the variables in `school`.**
