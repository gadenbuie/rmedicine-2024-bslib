## bslib layouts

- `page_sidebar()`
- `card()`
    - with card parts
- `layout_columns()`
- full screen cards

::: {.column-screen-inset-right}
```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
## file: app.R
library(shiny)
library(bslib)

ui <- page_fluid(

)

server <- function(input, output, session) {

}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

We're in the process of refactoring an older Shiny app to use new features from bslib.
I've started refactoring `exercises/02_app.R` by pulling out the inputs so it's easier to see the layout.

Your task is to migrate the UI section of the app from `shiny::fluidPage()` and `shiny::sidebarLayout()` to use page and layout functions from `{bslib}`.

## Value Boxes


::: {.column-screen-inset-right}
```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer, terminal]
## file: app.R
library(shiny)
library(bslib)
library(collegeScorecard)

ui <- page_fluid(

)

server <- function(input, output, session) {

}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## 🧑‍💻 Your Turn {#your-turn-value-box}

::: lead
<i class="bi bi-folder-symlink-fill"></i> `exercises/03_app.R`
:::

The app in `exercises/03_app.R` contains the start of a dashboard where the user can pick a specific school and see a quick summary of information about the school.

I've set up all of the reactive server-side logic for you.
Your job is to create three visually appealing value boxes to describe:

1. The number of undergraduate students at the school.
2. The average yearly cost of the school.
3. The rate of completion at the school.

::: {.callout-tip}
Use the Build-A-Box app from the bslib package to explore value box options and to design the three value boxes.
The [app is available online](https://bslib.shinyapps.io/build-a-box/) or locally by running

```r
shiny::runExample("build-a-box", package = "bslib")
```
