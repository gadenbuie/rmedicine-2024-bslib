## Filling Layouts

### Heights in nested containers

Block elements, at least by default on the web, take up full width but are **lazy about their height**.
In general, a block element's height is driven by the height of its contents.

The example below uses [basic Boostrap markup for a card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/).
What happens when you...

* Resize the width of the page?
* Adjust the height of the leaflet output?
* Add additional text to the card using `lorem::ipsum(2, 1:2)`?
* Give the card a fixed height?

::: {.column-screen-inset-right}
```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]

{{< include "../examples/app-fillability-height.R" >}}
```

### Filling layouts

bslib introduced the concept of filling layouts to solve a common problem in Shiny apps, especially dashboards.

::: {.lead .fst-italic}
How can an output or layout take up all of the space available to it?
:::

This flips the arrows of causality.
Instead of letting the plot or map drive the height of its containers, we want the map to take up whatever space it can.

In the example below, replace `card_basic()` with `bslib::card()`.
What happens when you...

* Change the height of the card?
* Add text to the card with `lorem::ipsum(2, 1:2)`?
* Make the card very tall or very short (with and without the extra text)?
* Replace `page_fixed()` with `page_fillable()`? (_Hint: make sure the viewer is wide enough._)

::: {.column-screen-inset-right}
```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]

{{< include "../examples/app-fillability-layouts.R" >}}
```

### Breaking fillability

Fillable layouts are really two elements working together:

1. A **fillable** container creates a space for filling.

2. A **fill** item can fill the container.

These two elements work together.
Filling layouts are only activated when fillable container is the **parent** &lrarr; of a fill item **child**.

To break fillability, you have three options:

1. Set `fill = FALSE` on the item.

2. Set `fillable = FALSE` on the parent.

3. Break the parent &lrarr; child relationship.

By default, bslib tends to break fillability on mobile devices to switch to a flow layout.
Look for `fillable_mobile` and set it to `TRUE` when you want fillable layouts on mobile screens.

The example below features a card with text, a button, and a map.
Make sure that the viewer pane is wide enough to activate the filling layout.

* Why is the button full width? Do you want that?
* How can we make the contents of the entire card scrollable?
* How can we make the map taller?

#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| viewerHeight: 500px

## Fillable Pages

There are three pages that provide page-level filling behavior and are useful for dashboards:

### `page_fillable()`

A screen-filling page layout.
Try settings these arguments:

* `padding`
* `gap`
* `fillable_mobile`
* `title`

::: {.column-screen-inset-right}
```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
{{< include "../examples/app-page-fillable.R" >}}
```
:::

### `page_sidebar()`

A dashboard layout with full-screen header and sidebar.
In addition to the arguments above, try setting these arguments:

* `sidebar`
* `bg`
* `fg`

::: {.column-screen-inset-right}
```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
{{< include "../examples/app-page-sidebar.R" >}}
```
:::

### `page_navbar()`

Another dashboard layout with a top-level navigation bar.
Pairs with `nav_panel()` elements.
Try setting these arguments:

* `fillable`
* `sidebar`
* `position`
* `underline`

Also add a `nav_spacer()` and a `nav_item()`.

::: {.column-screen-inset-right}
```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
{{< include "../examples/app-page-navbar.R" >}}
```

The app in `exercises/05_app.R` uses a lot of plots and components, some of which are familiar but none of which have enough space in the current layout.

Your task for this exercise is to make sure the plots are readable and usable at all screen sizes.
Consider the following options:

* Setting a minimum height via `min_height`
* Using `layout_columns()` or `layout_column_wrap()`
* Using `page_navbar()` or another page layout
* Breaking fillability as needed
